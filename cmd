# Bash Template Command

*This `README.md` is autogenerated.*

This is a GitHub template repo that will be copied instead of forked to
create a new Bash command with a command something like this:

```
gh repo create rwxrob/mycmd -p rwxrob/template-bash-command
```

This `command` inside can then be renamed and finished.

Obviously, not all of this is needed for many Bash scripts, but anything
with more than two subcommands will benefit from the builtin tab
completion, embedded Markdown help documentation support, and included
functions (`usage`, `_filter`, `_buffer`, `_have`, etc.)

## Naming Conventions

* Name repos containing single bash commands with `cmd-`
* Name template repos beginning with `template-`
* Start command functions with `command_` to be completed
* Start command functions with `command__` to not be completed

## Dependencies

Required:

* Bash 4+

Optional:

* `pandoc` - for rich help docs

## Justification

Bash is the dominate shell scripting language and the official default
Linux interactive shell, which reduces cognitive overhead; every command
line *is* a line of code that could be put into script as is. Bash
scripts are at the core of cloud, containers, and Kubernetes. Bash 4+
with its associative array support, powerful regular expressions, and
multiple ways of feeding data to loops easily covers the needs
previously requiring Python and Perl scripts. Bash scripts are also much
more powerful, safer, flexible, and performant than POSIX shell or Zsh.

## Guidelines

* Write GitHub Flavored Markdown only
* Use present tense ("outputs" over "will output")
* Prefer "output" and "display" over ~~print~~
* Follow the [naming conventions](#naming-conventions) 
* Use the official bash path: `#!/bin/bash`
* Use of `#!/usr/bin/bash` is outdated
* Using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` introduces unnecessary risk
* Explicitly export `PATH` in script when possible
* Always check script with [`shellcheck`] before releasing
* Always use `bc` for *any* floating point math

# Display Help Information

```
help [<command>]
```

Displays specific help information. If no argument is passed displays
general help information (main). Otherwise, the documentation for the
specific argument keyword is displayed, which usually corresponds to
a command name (but not necessarily). All documentation is written in
GitHub Flavored Markdown and will displayed as a web page if `pandoc`
and `$HELP_BROWSER` are detected, otherwise, just the Markdown is sent
to `$PAGER` (default: more).

Also see `readme` and `usage` commands.
